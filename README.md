# Binary Search Tree

This is The Odin Project curriculum's [Binary Search Tree](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees) project assignment

This project is intended to practice:

- How to build Binary Search Tree from sorted array
- How to insert value to Binary Search Tree
- How to remove value from Binary Search Tree
- How to traverse in Binary Search Tree using Queue and Breadth First Search algorithm (Level-order)
- How to traverse in Binary Search Tree using Stack and Depth First Search algorithm (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
- How to check height and depth of Binary Search Tree
- How to Re-balance unbalanced Binary Search Tree

### Usage

Warning: In order to run below commands you need to have installed Node.js on your PC

- Fork and clone the repo
- Inside local repo folder run `npm install` in the terminal to install required dependencies
- Test cases added in "index.js". Uncomment to test out (add desired test cases)
- In the terminal run `node index.js` to output data to the terminal

### Features

- `buildTree()` - build a Binary Search Tree
- `prettyPrint` - visualize Binary Search Tree in console
- `insert(value)` - insert value to Binary Search Tree
- `remove(value)` - remove value from Binary Search Tree
- `find(value)`- find the node of given value
- `levelOrder()` - traverse Binary Search Tree using Breadth First Search algorithm
- `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, `postOrder()` - traverse Binary Search Tree using Depth First Search algorithm
- `height(value)`, `depth(value)` - check height and depth of given node
- `isBalanced()` - check Binary Search Tree is balanced
- `reBalance()` - re-balance unbalanced Binary Search Tree
